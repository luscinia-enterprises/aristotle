                By creating virtual classrooms, teachers will be able to see the learning profiles of all their students
                in one convenient location. These unique profiles will identify custom resources adapted towards the
                student. Here, teachers will be able to assign suggested practice sets and material. Our monitoring
                system also enables teachers to track the progress of their students as they progress through the
                curriculum.
