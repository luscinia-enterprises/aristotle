                The development of Aristotle began with a group discussion between frustrated high school students. All
                of us had our issues with the educational system, and we were discussing how we could improve it. Many
                exciting ideas were brought up from many differing perspectives. We realized that unlike most aspects of
                modern life, the educational system has fundamentally remained unchanged for the last 150 years. That
                discussion lingered with us all for weeks, and we would occasionally bring it up. After extensive
                deliberation, we realized that as students, we possess a unique perspective on the woes of the current
                education system, and we had come to some substantive ideas on how we could improve it. In August of
                2018, Luscinia Enterprises Assn. was incorporated, determined to provide high-quality educational
                services to anybody that has the drive to learn. We decided to start by catering our services to the
                education curriculum of our home province of British Columbia. Our dream was to use the promise of
                technology to improve the educational experience of students, parents, and teachers alike. At first we
                made slow progress, the 2018-2019 school year was our senior year; extracurriculars, university
                applications, and much more put the development of Aristotle aside. But slowly and steadily we made
                progress because of our passion for the project. We are almost ready to make aristotle available for
                everyone.
